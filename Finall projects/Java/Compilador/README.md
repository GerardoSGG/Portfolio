This program is the one that took me the longest to develop since it is a compiler that works from a language created by me, 
this program performs a lexical analysis, a syntactic analysis and a semantic analysis from a text file that evaluates and
As output it gives us the errors that are in the document or if everything is written according to the grammars of my language,
it generates a text document with a code which is the translation of my language into assembly language 8086.

In the Grammar of my language file is the syntax of my language with which you can write programs and translate them to the 8086 assembly language.

In the src folder you can see the code and the following files

In the text_read document there is a program written in my language that what it does is show the Fibonacci series up to the number indicated.

The code translated into assembly language 8086 is displayed in the generated code file.

With this program we can write programs with my language and obtain as output the program written in assembly language 8086.
